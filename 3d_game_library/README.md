## Requirements

Ensure you have Python 3.12 installed. You can install the required packages using `pip`. Create a virtual environment and run:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt

The requirements.txt includes:

Panda3D: For advanced 3D rendering and game development.
Pyglet: For additional rendering support.
Pygame: For handling user input and other game development needs.
Numpy: For numerical operations.
Pillow: For image processing.

Installation
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/3d_game_library.git
Navigate into the project directory:

cd 3d_game_library
Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage

To start using the 3D Game Library, you can modify the main.py file or create your own scripts to interact with the library components.

Example
Here's a simple example of how to use the library to create a basic 3D scene:

from engine.panda3d_renderer import Panda3DRenderer
from engine.core import GameObject
from engine.objects import Cube

# Create a game object
cube = Cube(size=1)

# Initialize the renderer
renderer = Panda3DRenderer()
renderer.add_object(cube)
renderer.run()
